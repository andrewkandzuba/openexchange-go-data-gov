We issue patents and trademarks, as well as licenses to sell sensitive technologies abroad. We collect and provide data on demographics, the economy, and the weather, as well as a common language businesses can use to manage cybersecurity risk. We invest in advanced manufacturing clusters and facilitate foreign investment in the United States. We link minority-owned businesses with the capital, contracts, and markets they need to grow, and we connect communities across America through expanded broadband access.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout President Obama\u2019s Administration, we took strides to make our team more outcome-driven and responsive and provide important commercial perspectives in policy discussions. Critical to our success has been our work to build a stronger bridge to the business community, include the private sector in our policymaking process, and serve as a key member of the President\u2019s economic cabinet.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Chr \/\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ERecord of Progress\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Department of Commerce has played an integral role in America\u2019s economic recovery. While government alone cannot create companies or jobs, it can help create the conditions for the private sector to grow and prosper. Our record of progress is focused on five areas: trade and investment, innovation, data, environment, and operational excellence.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ETrade \u0026amp; Investment: Opening Global Markets and Encouraging Investment in the United States\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Department has supported the President\u2019s economic growth agenda by aggressively enforcing trade laws, increasing foreign direct investment, negotiating trade deals that create a level playing field for American workers, and using the power of America\u0027s business leaders to help shape policy in markets around the world. Our team has worked to steadily open new markets to U.S. goods and services, reduce trade barriers facing U.S. firms, and help our companies navigate challenging markets abroad.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECommercial Diplomacy\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/1015\u0022\u003ECommercial diplomacy\u003C\/a\u003E is based on a simple premise: America\u2019s commercial power and influence is unmatched. In an increasingly complex world, that power must be more effectively harnessed as a force alongside our more traditional foreign policy tools. Our allies and trading partners want American investment and the promise of private sector-led growth. And they know American companies can bring capital that creates jobs and economic opportunities. This provides our business leaders with an influential voice in foreign capitals, which can be used to promote policies consistent with our common strategic goals. This in turn helps level the playing field for American companies to sell more American products abroad while creating well-paying jobs here at home. As such, when our objectives have aligned, we have worked with the private sector as our policy partner. The Commerce Department has invested heavily in building a commercial diplomacy agenda, and the next Administration should continue developing more effective and focused commercial diplomacy strategies to support the President\u2019s foreign policy priorities.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEnforcing Our Trade Laws in Record Numbers\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe viability of U.S. manufacturers and the livelihoods of American workers has been threatened by ill-advised policies of certain foreign governments that subsidize the costs of production and artificially decrease the price of their exports at the expense of their trading partners. This Administration has taken substantial steps to confront this problem, and the Department has played a leading role. Antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations have reached historic highs. Specifically, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are currently enforcing 350 AD\/CVD orders that address dumped and\/or unfairly subsidized imports. To meet this challenge of increased dumping, we expanded our capacities by adding more than three dozen positions in an effort to more quickly and effectively use our trade remedies. We also secured legislative changes that strengthen the effectiveness of the AD\/CVD remedy, including provisions that improve Commerce\u2019s ability to deal with foreign producers that do not cooperate in AD\/CVD proceedings and enhance the ability of Customs and Border Protection to combat evasion of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChina\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe scope and nature of our interactions with the Chinese government has evolved dramatically. We have worked to make the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/584\u0022\u003EJoint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT)\u003C\/a\u003E a continuous process in tandem with the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and have made it a more dynamic and productive dialogue. While we have continued to use the JCCT to push the Chinese to address core commercial policy challenges \u2013 including excess capacity in steel and other sectors, the persistent theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, and an increasingly hostile and protectionist approach to digital policy challenges \u2013 we also have attempted to use it and our other engagements with senior officials to focus energy on deepening our understanding of their strategic economic priorities and looking for opportunities for greater collaboration. In addition, we are working to end China\u2019s dangerous and market-distorting approach to developing an indigenous semiconductor industry and have continued to prioritize and invest heavily in trade enforcement.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMexico\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nRecognizing that the U.S. government had underinvested in the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship, the Department prioritized building stronger bilateral commercial ties with one of our most important economic partners, and we have achieved enormous success. Working closely with Vice President Biden, the Department has led the High Level Economic Dialogue since its 2013 launch. This mechanism has enabled our governments to more effectively collaborate on commercial priorities like developing modern border infrastructure that promote growth and job creation. We have made considerable progress on border infrastructure, energy, economic and workforce development, travel and tourism, and innovation and entrepreneurship.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIndia\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe Department has taken the lead on elevating our commercial ties with India through the creation of the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. This mechanism will endure as a platform for commercial and strategic engagement on a wide range of issues. We have made great progress in key areas affecting our economic relationship, including ease of doing business, smart cities and infrastructure development, innovation and entrepreneurship, and standards harmonization.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAfrica\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nOne major goal of the Administration has been to transform the U.S.-Africa relationship from one based on aid to one based on trade. Consistent with these goals, the Department created and launched the President\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/1813\u0022\u003EDoing Business in Africa\u003C\/a\u003E initiative, which has allowed us to double our presence in African countries by opening new offices throughout the continent facilitating greater investment and supporting jobs here at home.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Department also created the U.S.-Africa Business Forums, which took place in 2014 and 2016. The Forums brought together hundreds of American and African CEOs, and nearly every African head of state to facilitate U.S. private sector engagement in Africa, which helped generate $23.1 billion in investment. The first U.S.-Africa Business Forum also led to the formation of the President\u0027s Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), which I chair.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECuba\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe Department has taken a lead role to fundamentally change U.S. policy toward Cuba. We launched the U.S.-Cuba Regulatory Dialogue and, in coordination with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Department has published six sets of regulatory changes aimed at empowering the Cuban people through increased economic engagement. From January 2015 through September 2016, we issued 738 licenses for proposed exports and re-exports to Cuba valued at $9.4 billion. In addition, we worked with the private sector to identify the most effective ways to increase economic engagement and ultimately benefit the Cuban people.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESelectUSA\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nIn 2011, the Department launched \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.selectusa.gov\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener noreferrer\u0022\u003ESelectUSA\u003C\/a\u003E, the first federal initiative focused on creating world-class investment promotions to attract foreign direct investment to the United States. To date, this successful effort has facilitated $23 billion in foreign direct investment creating and\/or retaining tens of thousands of jobs across the country.

Prior to this effort, the government\u2019s controls on defense items essentially were one-size-fits-all regardless of technological sensitivity, end use, or end user. Now, tens of thousands of less-sensitive defense items are subject to more nuanced and flexible regulations. The end result has been stronger military interoperability with our allies; reduced incentives for those allies\u2019 products to avoid U.S. content; government\u2019s resources focused on transactions of greatest concern; and improved regulatory reliability and predictability.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENational Travel and Tourism Strategy\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nIn partnership with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce co-authored the National Travel and Tourism Strategy, which sets an ambitious goal to welcome 100 million annual international visitors by 2021. In 2015, 76 million people visited the United States, up from 67 million before the strategy\u2019s implementation. These visitors spent a record $217 billion on goods and services, supporting 1.1 million U.S. jobs and making travel and tourism our country\u2019s number one services export.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ELooking Ahead\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EComplete the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe completion of the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/566\u0022\u003ETrans-Pacific Partnership\u003C\/a\u003E is essential to America\u2019s economic strength, to our leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, and to our national security. But trade remains a complicated and highly charged topic for many citizens. To address these challenges, our government needs to reconsider our approach to delivering the benefits of completed trade agreements to our citizens. In addition, the inability of Congress to pass the agreement has left a vacuum that China is already attempting to fill with its own multilateral agreement that will exclude the U.S. and disadvantage our businesses and workers.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGrowing Our Footprint at Home and Abroad\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe Department\u2019s traditional trade responsibilities include helping American companies resolve specific issues abroad, working with foreign governments to address systemic trade policy challenges, enforcing trade laws, and building stronger ties to cultivate economic opportunities for companies to compete for new customers around the world. Globalization is creating a huge and growing demand by American companies for the Department\u2019s trade services and expertise. To meet this challenge and accomplish these goals, I believe there exists a need to increase the Department\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/1684\u0022\u003EForeign Commercial Service\u003C\/a\u003E and Export Assistance\u00a0Center footprint as well as our enforcement resources, so that we can keep pace with growing caseloads.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIncrease Exports\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nIn addition, we need to open new markets and help U.S. companies grow exports. Rebalancing our economy to sell more globally is necessary because 95 percent of the world\u2019s consumers live outside the United States. This will represent an important shift in how our economy does business. We need to open new markets and maintain a level playing field, simultaneous with expanded export counseling and trade finance capabilities. To meet this opportunity, the Department\u2019s Commercial Service should expand to ensure that all American firms in tradeable sectors fully capitalize on the opportunities created by our trade agreements.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Chr \/\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EInnovation: Supporting Advanced Manufacturing, Skills Training, Entrepreneurship, and a Robust Digital Economy\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween 1948 and 2012, over half the total increase in U.S. productivity growth, a key driver of economic growth, came from innovation and technological advancement.

These resources also inform state, local, and business decision-making to strengthen resilience. In addition, we are providing unique market intelligence to help industry strategically deploy resources in renewable energy, smart grid, and traditional environmental technologies. We are also informing mitigation planning, and making businesses and communities more hazard-resilient through efforts such as our Disaster Resilience Framework.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImproving Weather Predictions and Supporting Key Decision Makers\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe Department is strengthening the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/624\u0022\u003ENational Weather Service\u003C\/a\u003E to be more responsive to stakeholder needs and more effective in supporting emergency managers, first responders, government officials, businesses, and the public.

We just launched the most advanced weather satellite ever built. Called GOES-R, it will revolutionize forecasting and save lives by collecting three times more data and providing four times better resolution, enabling more effective and targeted warnings of severe weather events. Given the current age and capabilities of our polar orbiting satellites, we must prioritize and execute the planned 2017 launch of JPSS-1 to ensure there will be no gaps in satellite coverage.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOpening the National Water Center\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nIn May 2015 the Department opened the National Water Center at the University of Alabama, the first facility in the nation dedicated to water forecast operations and research.

During this Administration, we have largely ended the practice of overfishing and successfully rebuilt a record number of fishery stocks that have been depleted. Due to our effective management, overfishing has hit an all-time low and 40 stocks have been returned to productive levels. The U.S. fishing industry contributed nearly $200 billion to the American economy in 2014 and supports 1.83 million jobs. Nevertheless, improper fishing continues to undermine the economic and environmental sustainability of global fisheries. The Department co-chaired the President\u2019s Task Force on Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing to level the economic playing field by combating international pirate fishing and seafood fraud.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBuilding a 21st Century Fleet\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nOver the last eight years, we have added three modern vessels to our world-class oceanographic research fleet to support the nation\u2019s economic and environmental needs. These vessels provide a wide range of services to the nation, from supporting the science that underpins economic fishery management decisions to charting coastal ports and seaways essential to the maritime industry.\u00a0 However, without new and sustained investment in the future, the aging fleet will be reduced to half its size in just over a decade.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERestoring Gulf Coast Ecosystems\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nFollowing the Deep Water Horizon oil spill and the subsequent the implementation of the RESTORE Act in 2012, the Department has stood up the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council whose mission is to rebuild and revitalize the ecosystems and economy of the Gulf Coast.

The Department\u2019s success stems from the tone and objectives President Obama set to generate broad-based prosperity in America. As part of his commitment to economic growth, he recognized that the Administration needed a stronger relationship with the business community and that our private sector leaders needed to be involved in the policymaking process. Our team has taken that vision seriously and has worked to implement those economic priorities over the last eight years.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have come to believe that American businesses and the American taxpayer would be much better served by a streamlined \u201cDepartment of Business,\u201d similar to the President\u2019s 2012 government reorganization proposal. A reorganized Department with a unified strategic plan for trade negotiations and enforcement, economic development, export financing, production of economic statistics and data, technology, and other business-focused services would provide stronger customer service to American businesses competing in a global economy.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EServing as the 38th Secretary of Commerce has truly been one of the great honors of my life.
