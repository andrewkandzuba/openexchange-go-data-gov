# openexchange-go-data-gov

Demonstration of CQRS pattern in Golang

# Problem statement

Service to visualize Federal Commerce News feed.

## Solution

We are going to subscribe to [Commerce.gov News API](https://api.commerce.gov/api/news?api_key=DEMO_KEY) stream and poll from it
periodically in order to collect updates. 

All updates will be streamed into a queue (probably Apache Kafka) then consumed independently from the harvesting process. 
Upon consumption deduplication will be made then all new articles will be parsed out and persisted into a database.
 
The special web service will host REST API to query articles: 

- All with a pagination 

- Facet search by categories 

- Wildcard search      

## Technical requirements 

- Application should be written in Golang.

- Application to be hosted in a public cloud (preferably in Google Cloud Engine)

- Following tools are permitted:
    - https://github.com/labstack/echo
    - https://github.com/go-resty/resty 
    - https://github.com/buger/jsonparser 
    - https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm
    - https://github.com/Shopify/sarama
 
## Building instructions

### Local 

- Install and configure the latest version of [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) specific to your development environment.
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Login to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
- Building steps:
    - > git clone https://github.com/andrewkandzuba/openexchange-go-data-gov
    - > cd openexchange-go-data-gov
    - > ./build.sh
    - > ./ci

- If your environment is Window build like this:
    - > CGO_ENABLED=1;CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc ./build.sh
    - > CGO_ENABLED=1;CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc ./ci.sh
 
### Google Cloud Build 

TBD
 
## Components

- [config](pkg/config) - Configuration helper to init application properties from YAML and/or environment variables.  
- [connector](pkg/connector) - Data.gov Commerce New REST API client.  
- [stream](pkg/stream) - Commerce API News stream.
- [ingress](pkg/ingress) - News Articles ingression service.
- [db](pkg/db) - News Articles database repository. 
- [web](pkg/web) - Query web service.
- [channel](pkg/channel) - Producer / Consumer API.
- [kafka](pkg/kafka) - Producer / Consumer API implementation for Apache Kafka.
- [main](cmd/application) - Main application to demo how it all works together.  
- [tests](tests) - Continues Integration tests.  

## The flow 

The application is designed based on classical CQRS pattern:

- Data harvesting flows
[Data.gov Commerce News API] -> [connector] -> [stream] -> [channel] -> [ingress] -> [db]

- Query flow
[db] -> [web] -> [client]

## Kubernetes deployment 

TBD 

## ToDos

- Replace default test coverage tool with https://github.com/grosser/go-testcov.
- Switch to MySQL and move the environment's initialization into Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
- Externalize timeouts configuration.
- Implement retry and back-off for external API.
- Bug in echo 4.1.15 !!! https://github.com/labstack/echo/issues/1492
- Replace in memory channel based communication [connector] -> [ingress] by Apache Kafka integration.
